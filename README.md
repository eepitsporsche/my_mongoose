## Description
My Mongoose serves as the back-end functionality of a full-stack social network app. Various API endpoints allow functions to create, modify, and delete users, user posts, and reactions to user posts through Express.js routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.

Future development for this app could include functions to create a list of favorite thoughts wherein users may save and delete thoughts.


## Installation
[Clone the repository](https://github.com/eepitsporsche/my_mongoose) to your machine and open the application in VS Code.

Enter the command <code>npm init</code> into the VS Code terminal to install Node.

Enter <code>npm install</code> into the VS code terminal to install the required dependencies.

Install [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v6.0/installation/) on your machine to operate database functionality of the My Mongoose app.

Install [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download) on your machine to operate route functionality of the My Mongoose app.
